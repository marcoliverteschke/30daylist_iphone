# 30daylist

See that app? It's only 99 cents! Go on, just buy it.

Are impulse buys burning a hole in your wallet? Join the club.

Also, download 30daylist, the last impulse buy you ever need to make.

## What does it do?

Say you see something interesting, an app, a piece of clothing, whatever. You dig in your pockets but instead of whipping out your wallet, you calmly reach for your iPhone, launch 30daylist and add the item to your list. You enter the name of the thing, the price and where you've seen it (the name of the place and the URL or GPS-position). Then you just turn around and walk away.

The item will be on your list for 30 days. On day 30 you will get a reminder to review that item. Does it still seem appealing? Great, then open the URL or have Maps direct you to the place where you took the note. Take a deep breath and lay out the cash.
